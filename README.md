# Call-Centre-Analysis-(Power BI)

For this project, I work with a dataset provided by a call centre manager at PhonePay. Their goal is to gain transparency and insights from their call centre data. Specifically, they're looking for an accurate overview of long-term trends in customer and agent behaviour. Your task is to create a dashboard focusing on call centre trends, customer retention, and diversity and inclusion. This dashboard will serve as a basis for discussion with management.

I divided this project into 3 tasks and created 3 separate dashboards, 
Task 1: Call Centre Performance 
Task 2: All customer profiles and Churned customer profiles 
Task 3: diversity and inclusion.

TASK 1:
I analyze the call centre performance report sent to me. Here are some of the key insights from the report:
•	Overall Performance: The call centre answered 4,054 out of 5,000 calls received (81.08%). The report doesn't mention a specific target for calls answered, but a higher percentage of calls answered is generally considered better. The call centre was able to resolve 72.9% of calls.
•	Agent Performance: Jim answered the highest number of calls (536) at an average speed of 53 seconds. Dan and Becky have the highest resolution rate (90.4%) among the agents mentioned in the report.
•	Calls by Topic: The report shows that the call centre received the highest number of calls related to Admin Support (976), followed by Streaming (1022) and Technical Support (1019).
•	Calls by Resolution: Out of the 4054 calls answered, 3646 (90.2%) were resolved by the call centre agents.
•	Agent Satisfaction: The report shows that all agents have a high satisfaction rating, with an average of 4.5.
Overall, the call centre seems to be performing well based on the metrics shown in the report.

TASK 2 (Dashboard 1):
The dashboard is a customer churn analysis (all customers) for a telecommunication company. Here are some of the insights glean from it:
•	Customer demographics: The company appears to have a slightly higher proportion of male (59.5%) customers compared to female (40.5%).
•	Customer Tenure: A nearly equal number of customers have been with the company for less than a year (3,875) and more than a year (3,168). There seems to be a higher churn rate among customers on month-to-month contracts (682) compared to those on one-year (1,473) or two-year contracts (1,695).
•	Customer Services: A significant number of customers avail phone services (6361) and internet services (3498). However, it is important to note that the total number of customers (7,043) is greater than the number of customers who avail internet services, which might be due to customers availing multiple services.
•	Payment Methods: The most popular payment methods used by customers are bank transfers (2,365) and credit cards (2,105). Nearly a quarter of the customers (1,612) opt for paperless billing (e-statements).
Overall, the dashboard suggests that the company might benefit from focusing on customer retention strategies, particularly for those on month-to-month contracts. Since a significant number of customers use phone services, the company might also want to investigate if offering bundled services (phone and internet) could be an effective strategy.
TASK 2 (Dashboard 2):
Dashboard shows customer churn analysis (churned customers) for a telecommunication company. Here are some insights glean from it:
•	Number of Churned Customers: There are a total of 1,869 churned customers.
•	Contract Duration: Among the churned customers, a majority (1,655) were on month-to-month contracts. This suggests that customers on month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn compared to those on longer contracts (one year or two years).
•	Internet Service: Looking at the internet service used by churned customers, DSL seems to have a higher churn rate (1,699) compared to Fiber Optic (170).
•	Customer Demographics: There are more churned male customers (930) than female customers (939). However, it is important to note that the data might not represent the entire customer base demographics since this only reflects churned customers.
•	Customer Services: A vast majority of churned customers (1,461) had phone service. Similarly, a significant number (1,446) had online security services.
•	Account Information: The most popular payment method among churned customers was bank transfer (1,071), followed by credit card (713). Interestingly, a relatively high number of churned customers (669) opted for paperless billing (e-statements).

TASK 3 (Dashboard 1):
Dashboard shows diversity and inclusion (D&I) metrics of a company by department, job level, age, region, and gender. Here are some of the insights glean from it:
•	Hiring: Overall, the company seems to have a balanced hiring rate for females (50%) and males (50%) across all departments and job levels. However, there seems to be a lack of diversity in terms of age groups, with a higher concentration of hires between 30-50 years old.
•	Promotions: Promotions appear to favor males across most departments and job levels. For instance, in the Senior Manager position, 82% of promotions went to males, while only 18% went to females.
•	Turnover Rate: The average performance rating of leavers is generally lower than that of stayers across all departments and job levels. This suggests that employees with lower performance ratings are more likely to leave the company.
The company can create a more inclusive work environment and improve employee satisfaction.
TASK 3 (Dashboard 2):
•	Gender Representation: Across all job levels and departments, the company seems to have a balanced gender representation with females making up 49% of the workforce and males 51%.
•	Management Roles: However, females seem to be underrepresented in executive positions. Executive FY21 shows that only 12.5% of executives are females, whereas males hold 87.5%. This imbalance is consistent across all departments.
•	Promotions: Looking at promotions to executive positions in FY20, promotions for females (13%) lagged behind those for males (87%).
•	Age Distribution: The company also appears to have an age gap in its workforce. While the data doesn't show specific age ranges, it does show a higher concentration of employees in the 30-49 age group. This suggests a potential lack of younger or older employees.
The company can develop a more effective D&I strategy and build a more well-rounded workforce.
